# X1-Yoga Scripts

This repo contains a bunch of useful scripts for running linux on a lenovo x1 carbon yoga.

# Dependenciese
At the moment there aren't many dependencies, and you probably already have them installed.

  - xf86-input-wacom
  - xorg-xrandr

# Scripts
- rotate.sh should be run in the background and uses wacomrot.sh to rotate the input, so leave them in the same folder.
- wacomrot.sh is a helper script to rotate wacom input.

# Credits
- Thanks to the Arch wiki for wacomrot.sh : https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wacom_tablet#Xrandr_Setup
